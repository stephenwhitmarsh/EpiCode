- modify output format from float32 to int16 to allow reading by Muse.
- add 'ÂµV' in the header text file, otherwise Muse cannot read it

For neuralynx data, add of this hdr field before calling write_neuralynx_ncs : 
# ncs.hdr.AcqEntName            = LABEL;
It allows Muse to get the channel name on such written data

Add our own fields so they are also cut in trials (samples, amplitudes)

ft_spike_select, lines commented with '%paul'
Also, add our own fields (samples, amplitudes, template, template_maxchan, cluster_group).
Besides, I changed a bit the selection of trials. Before, the trials to remove were emptied but they still existed. Here, I re-numbered the trials to they really do not exist anymore (for exemple for trials 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, if trial 4 is removed, I renumber trial 5 to trial 4, so the re-numbered trials in spike.trial are 1 2 3 4). So I can also remove trials in spike.trialinfo and spike.trialtime, which were not the case before. I did it because leaving empty trials instead of removing it could create biais in further analysis.

Correct one error in one specific case due to histc output if first argument is of length 1

ft_read_event : 2 lines commented with %Paul
while reading nev files, the low-function read_neuralynx_nev outputs a string associated to each event. In order to keep this information, I added it to the event structure outputed by ft_read_event
